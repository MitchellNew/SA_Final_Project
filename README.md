SA Final Project
This is my Final Project for my System Analysis class.
This is a readme file. In this repository you will find the python code for SpiderSilk Hospital.

Problem:
The Territory of Life's Web is known across Chimeric society for the expertise of its doctors. However due to an increase of internet usage in the Imperial Dragon Lands along the Life's Webs' Western border, the Insectoid beings that call the nation their home need to get in on the internet game.
After several months of begging, CEO Kara Arachne of SpiderSilk Hospital convinced Emperess Hornet to allow the hospital's IT Staff to use an open source development system to create an online interface for her staff and patients. Using this interface the doctors and staff of the hospital would be able to clock their hours, new employees would be confirmed into the staff roster on their first day of work, and patients would be able to log in and schedule appointments.

Solution:
The web application that myself and my fellow IT staff were told to make was made in Flask utilizing SQLite3 and Bootstrap. SQLite3 makes the database and Bootstrap provides the styling and mobile device support. GitHub allows other IT departments of other hospitals in our nation to contribute to our project.

Instructions:
Please refer to the accompanying requirements.txt document to find additional instructions. Please run the application from your web browser.
